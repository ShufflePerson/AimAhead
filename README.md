**Enhance your gameplay with AimAhead, the intelligent AI aimbot that brings unparalleled accuracy to your fingertips.**

AimAhead utilizes the power of cutting-edge AI to identify and target enemies directly from your screen. By processing real-time screen captures through a sophisticated AI model, AimAhead provides precise and responsive aiming assistance, giving you the edge you need in competitive gaming.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Precision:**  Experience the next level of aiming accuracy driven by advanced artificial intelligence. AimAhead intelligently analyzes your screen to detect and lock onto targets with remarkable speed and precision.
*   **Model Optimization with TensorRT:**  AimAhead automatically compiles your chosen AI model into a TensorRT engine, leveraging the full potential of your NVIDIA GPU for optimized performance and lightning-fast target acquisition. This optimization process is a one-time setup, ensuring smooth and efficient operation thereafter.
*   **Highly Customizable Aimbot:** Tailor AimAhead to your exact playstyle with a comprehensive suite of adjustable settings:

    *   **Toggleable Aimbot:** Activate or deactivate the aimbot functionality instantly.
    *   **Always Aim Mode:**  Engage continuous aim assistance for constant target tracking.
    *   **Customizable Keybindings:**  Set your preferred keys for activating the aimbot and triggerbot features.
    *   **Adjustable Sensitivity:** Fine-tune the aiming speed to match your reflexes and preferences.

*   **Intelligent Triggerbot System:**  Go beyond aiming with the integrated triggerbot, designed for smart and responsive firing:

    *   **Auto Trigger:** Automatically fire when your crosshair aligns perfectly with an enemy.
    *   **Recoil Compensation:**  Intelligently adjust the auto trigger to compensate for weapon recoil, maintaining accuracy during sustained fire.
    *   **Recoil Adjustment Control:**  Customize the amount and timing of recoil compensation for different weapons and scenarios.
    *   **Trigger Delay:**  Introduce a slight delay to the auto trigger for a more human-like firing pattern.

*   **Predictive Aiming:** Stay one step ahead of your opponents with predictive targeting:

    *   **Next Frame Prediction:**  Anticipate enemy movement by analyzing previous frames to predict their position in the next frame, leading to more accurate shots on moving targets.
    *   **Prediction Frame Control:**  Adjust the number of frames used for prediction to balance responsiveness and accuracy based on your game and system.

*   **Smart Target Selection:**  Choose the targeting behavior that suits your strategy:

    *   **Targeting Modes:**
        *   **OBJECTIVE:** Prioritizes targets with the highest AI confidence, ensuring you focus on the most likely threats.
        *   **CLOSEST:**  Targets the enemy closest to your crosshair for immediate engagement in fast-paced situations.
    *   **Aim Positions:**
        *   **TOP (Headshots):**  Maximize damage by aiming directly for the head.
        *   **MIDDLE (Torso):**  A more forgiving aim position for consistent hits.

*   **Anti-Jitter Technology:**  Maintain smooth and stable aiming, even in chaotic engagements:

    *   **Jitter Reduction:**  Prevents erratic target switching when multiple enemies are nearby, ensuring a focused and consistent aim.
    *   **Jitter Sensitivity:**  Define the threshold for jitter detection to customize the smoothness of target switching.
    *   **Target Reappearance Wait Time:**  Set a delay before switching to a new target that briefly disappears and reappears, preventing unwanted target shifts.

*   **Developer & Training Features:** (For advanced users and potential contributors)

    *   **Automatic Training Data Collection:**  Effortlessly contribute to improving AimAhead's AI by automatically saving gameplay data for model training.
    *   **Hidden Cursor Detection:**  Optimize performance by only running the AI model when the cursor is hidden during active gameplay.
    *   **FPS Cap:**  Control resource usage by setting a frame rate cap for AimAhead's processing.
    *   **Model Selection:** Easily switch between different AI models to experiment and find the best performance.
    *   **Minimum Top Margin:**  Fine-tune headshot accuracy by adjusting the minimum margin for the "TOP" aim position.

*   **Visual Feedback:**  Stay informed with on-screen visual aids:

    *   **Target Drawing:**  Visually highlight detected enemies on your screen for clear target confirmation.
    *   **Confidence Display:**  See the AI's confidence level for each target, providing insight into target accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

*   **NVIDIA GPU:**  For optimal performance and TensorRT acceleration.
*   **CUDA 12.4:**  Ensure you have the correct CUDA Toolkit version installed. Download it from the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Archive](developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive).

## üìÇ Model Management

1.  **Place your ONNX models** into the `models` directory.
2.  Upon launching AimAhead, it will automatically detect and list the models in the configuration menu.
3.  **First-time model loading will trigger TensorRT compilation.** This optimization process may take 5-10 minutes but is performed only once per model, creating an optimized engine file for your GPU. Subsequent loading will be significantly faster.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Install the Requirements:** Ensure you have an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA 12.4 installed as outlined in the [Requirements](#-requirements) section.
2.  **Download AimAhead:** Obtain the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ShufflePerson/AimAhead/releases) (if you have releases set up).
3.  **Place Models:** Put your ONNX models in the `models` directory.
4.  **Run AimAhead:** Launch the AimAhead executable.
5.  **Configure:**  Use the in-game or configuration menu to adjust settings and keybindings to your liking.
6.  **Enjoy Enhanced Gameplay!**
